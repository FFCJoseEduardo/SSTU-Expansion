	@description = SSTU - ShipCore: Engines - M-1.  After the mission planners at SSTU developed the powerfull J-2, they started asking themselves "how far can we go with this?". The result of that question was the M-1 engine, which we still believe to be a joke from Wehrner Von Kerman. Von Kerman told us it's supposed to be an Upper Stage engine, but we think that might have been another joke. I mean, look at the size of this thing!
